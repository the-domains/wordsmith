Kimberly Burton Allen was born and raised in Orange County, California. From an early age she was a prolific reader and writer, attracted to "what makes people tick." Though she received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from California State University, Fullerton, she found more practical applications for her creative talents in the field of advertising and marketing. From her start as a copywriter in advertising agencies, she eventually rose to AVP of advertising and marketing for a small corporation in Irvine, CA.

When her husband Christopher, a formally-trained British butler, was offered a position on the East Coast in 1992, Kimberly took the opportunity of relocation to pursue her dream of writing, beginning by making good on the half-joking promise she'd made to Chris shortly after their first meeting--to write a book about his life as a butler. In 1995, unagented, she sold "A Butler's Life: Scenes From the Other Side of the Silver Salver" to Frederic C. Beil Publishing on the first round of submissions. The book was published in hardcover in 1997 and remains in print both in paperback and on Kindle. In the interim, having been a bridesmaid a full dozen times prior to becoming a bride, she sold "Wedding Wonders," on the origin of wedding customs still in practice today, to Great Quotations.

Following the publication of A Butler's Life, Kimberly turned to her first love--writing fiction. She has published two psychological suspense novels, "Blood Exposure" and "Net Stalker," and one of women's fiction, "Choice," all of which deal with the corrosive secrets that can destroy a family.

Kimberly lives on the East End of Long Island, NY, where she and her husband own and operate a bed and breakfast, for which she has published "A Butler's Manor: The Cookbook" of her most requested breakfast menus.
